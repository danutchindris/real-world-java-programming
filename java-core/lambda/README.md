# Lambda Expressions

Many of us are familiar with event handlers and callbacks, where we register an object containing a method to be used when some event happens.
Lambda expressions make this sort of idea much more widely usable in Java.
Lambdas and method references provide the ability to concisely pass code or methods as arguments to be executed in the middle of doing something else.
This idea occurs very frequently; for instance, parameterizing a sort method with code to do the comparison, or expressing complex queries on collections.
