# Functions

## Motivation

>Functional programs contain no assignment statements, so variables, once given a value, never change.
>More generally, functional programs contain no side-effects at all. A function call can have no effect
>other than to compute its result. This eliminates a major source of bugs, and also makes the order of execution
>irrelevant — since no side-effect can change an expression’s value, it can be evaluated at any time.
>This relieves the programmer of the burden of prescribing the flow of control. Since expressions can be
>evaluated at any time, one can freely replace variables by their values and vice versa—that is,
>programs are "referentially transparent." This freedom helps make functional programs more tractable mathematically
>than their conventional counterparts.
